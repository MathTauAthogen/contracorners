#How to run:
Compile with ```g++-12 -std=c++23 main.cpp -o a.out```.

Then, run with ```./a.out```.

#To debug:

Compile with ```g++-12 -std=c++23 main.cpp -o a.out -g```.

Then, run with ```gdb ./a.out```, and use the command "run".

## System Requirements

Needs c++23 obviously (might be able to make do with c++20 I forget but I think there was one thing that is only doable in c++23).

I have a ASUS Creator Laptop Q OLED, and the screen for this fits the grid relatively nicely (a bar at the bottom and right side but that is it) when I use the normal Windows Subsystem for Linux zoom out function about 4 times (I forget).
